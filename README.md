# RoboBouncer
Simple permission-based whitelisting for Paper servers

To grant someone access to your server, use a permission manager (such as [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/)) to grant players the `robobouncer.join` permission.
Anyone with op is automatically allowed.

The kick message can be changed in the config. The config can be reloaded with `/robobouncer reload` by players with the `robobouncer.reload` permission.

That's about all this plugin does.
